## Day 2: What is a Loop? ðŸ”„

- **Learned**: A loop makes the computer repeat stuffâ€”like counting or checking things. 
- **Types**:  
  - *For Loop*: Repeats a set number of times.  
  - *While Loop*: Keeps going as long as somethingâ€™s true.  
  - *Do-While Loop*: Runs at least once, then checks (C++ and Java only).    
- *Takeaway*: Loops are like magic for doing things over and over without extra work. ðŸŒŸ
