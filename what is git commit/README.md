## Day 3: What is "Git Commit"? ðŸ’¾

- **Learned**: A "Git commit" saves my code changes with a note, like a checkpoint. 
- **Steps**:  
  - *Add*: Use `git add` to pick what to save.  
  - *Commit*: Use `git commit -m "message"` to save it with a note.   
- *Takeaway*: Commits keep my work safe and show what Iâ€™ve doneâ€”like a progress diary. ðŸš€
