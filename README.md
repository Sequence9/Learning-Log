# Learning-Log
A daily log of things I've learned—quick bites of code, tools, and concepts, etc. Also used for notetaking.

## Day 1: What is a Variable? 🗃️

- **Learned**: A variable is like a named box that holds stuff—like numbers or words.
- **Random Fact**: Each language does it a little differently.
- **Examples**:  
  - **C++**: `int age = 20;` (a box for numbers, ends with `;`)  
  - **Java**: `int age = 20;` (same as C++, needs `;` too)  
  - **Python**: `age = 20` (no fancy stuff, just name and value)  

*Takeaway*: Variables are how I save things to use later in code.
